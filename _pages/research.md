My research projects tend to fall in the interesting intersection of oceanic fluid mechanics, computational science, and mathematics.
More concretely, I enjoy the (often cyclical) work-flow of
1. Devising / deriving physically meaningful mathematical diagnostics for analyzing ocean data
2. Developing high-efficiency computer routines to implement those diagnostics
3. Analyzing / interpreting / contextualizing the diagnostics to learn new things about the world's oceans

## Disentangling Large-scale Oceanic Flows

## Open-source Tool Development

I'm the lead developer of [FlowSieve](https://github.com/husseinaluie/FlowSieve), a C++ library that provides tools for analyzing global ocean data.
