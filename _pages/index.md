# About

I am a researcher associate at the University of Rochester in the [complex flow group](http://www.complexflowgroup.com) studying multi-scale physics in oceanographic processes and the mechanisms by which energy is transferred across scales in the world's oceans. 
I earned a Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics at the University of Waterloo, Canada, where I studied geophysical fluid dynamics under Francis Poulin, with a focus on model development and application to stratified quasi-geostrophic systems. 
I then joined the University of Rochester as Postdoctoral Research Associate from 2019 until 2022, when he was promoted to Research Associate in the Department of Mechanical Engineering. 
My work is primarily in computational fluid dynamics, with a focus on geophysical and oceanographic applications. 

I am the lead developer of [FlowSieve](https://github.com/husseinaluie/FlowSieve), an open-source tool to help enable the scientific community to easily and efficiently apply multi-scale decompositions in spherical / Earth-like settings.

In my spare time, I like reading, cycling, running, yoga, and am a devout Star Trek fan.
